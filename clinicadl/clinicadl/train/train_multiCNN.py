    Trains one CNN per patch and writes for each CNN:
        - logs obtained with Tensorboard during training,
        - best models obtained according to two metrics on the validation set (loss and balanced accuracy),
        - final performances at the end of the training.
    Performances are also aggregated at the image level and combines the output of all networks.
    The initialization state is shared across all networks.

    If the training crashes it is possible to relaunch the training process from the checkpoint.pth.tar and
    optimizer.pth.tar files which respectively contains the state of the model and the optimizer at the end
    of the last epoch that was completed before the crash.
